in this homwwrok the main thing is to create Weather API 

Here is what i did , 

first you need to sign in and Git the apikey from the website 
<!-- const apiKey = "";
    let url = 'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/';
    let requestType = ""; 
    let query =""; -->
    Second you need to make the function to get the weather for you 
    <!-- requestType = 'weather';
      query = `?${city}&units=imperial&appid=${apiKey}`;
      queryURL = `${url}${requestType}${query}`; -->
The most important thing is that you need to the Ajax so as you can call the api through the Ajax 
<!-- $.ajax({
        url: queryURL,
        method: 'GET' -->
also you need to make sure that you read all Doc.
